# Machine Learning Projects with PyTorch

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). These projects are designed to help you learn PyTorch, Python, and machine learning concepts. They cover a wide range of applications and difficulty levels.

## Projects

1. **Text Classification with RNN/LSTM:**
   - Description: Build a text classification model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory networks (LSTMs).
   - Dataset: [IMDb for sentiment analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
   - Difficulty: Beginner.

2. **Image Classification with CNN:**
   - Description: Create an image classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
   - Datasets: [MNIST, CIFAR-10](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/datasets.html).
   - Difficulty: Beginner.

3. **Chatbot with Seq2Seq Models:**
   - Description: Develop a chatbot using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models for conversational AI.
